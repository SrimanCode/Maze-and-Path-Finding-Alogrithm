# Path-Finding-Algorithm
A simple Path finding algorithm in python

Python Library needed in this program
- Networkx (pip install networkx)
- pygame (pip install networkx)

To select a start and end node in the grid enter the button "s" in the keyboard and select two square nodes in the grid. The selected start node and end node will
appear in red.
You can then use the "b" key to initialize the bfs in the grid.

The program then computes the path between the start and end node and give you the shortest path
